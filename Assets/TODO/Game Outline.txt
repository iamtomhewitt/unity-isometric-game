STORY
=======
Multiple world style levels like in new super mario bros (grass, dungeon, others). Character's best friend Wilbur the pig has been stolen by the boss of that world, for example
grass world is the minion boss, dungeon could be a giant spider or something.

Objective is to progress through the levels and defeat enemies along the way.

There are enemies, and pickups, and an end portal to get to to complete the level.

There is a boss battle, and after defeated, wilbur is stolen by another boss (??) hence transitioning into the next world.


PUZZLES
=======
- Switch & Bridge
- Platformers
- Bomb & Wall (bomb dispenser + push?)
- Laser & target (push laser block)
- General Push blocks?
- Elevator block that rises when stood on, and goes down as soon as jumped off
- Moving platforms

lara croft go has some good level design ideas
